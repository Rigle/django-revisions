What the heck is this?
----------------------

There are a lot of versioning apps out there, either in a state of decrepitude, or functional but with a colvoluted or suboptimal design. This app intends to become the de-facto standard to manage revisions in Django.

But not quite yet. Because it's more alpha than alpha and it has failing tests. Just so y'know. You can run the tests yourself with python revisions/tests/testrunner.py
